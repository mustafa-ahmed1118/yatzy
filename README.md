This is a basic implementation of Yatzy. It rolls 5 dice and tracks the number of rolls.

## How to Run:

1. Open "test.html"
2. Game begins upon opening in browser
3. Roll the 5 dice by pressing the space bar
4. If 4 rolls are acheived the game resets

## Future Goals:

The next steps with this project is to implement the rules of yatzy and score keeping for the project. This functionality was optional for the lab.
